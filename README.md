# JCSU: Digital Signage
The Joe Crowley Student Union has public digital signage placed throughout the building. Some display which vendors in the building are still open and others displays a list of the events taking place in the building on that day. During the upgrade to Rise Vision from Visix, a new way was needed to get the data to these displays.
